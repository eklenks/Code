    "In general, from the conducted experiments, we discovered that the rolling window setup is better than the cumulative window setup. Also, re-estimating the cointegration vector monthly improves the performance of the strategy. It is better to exclude further history when estimating the cointegration vector, as the cointegration relationship between the $N$ assets are time-varying. It also provides circumstantial evidence that the following assumptions of the model are reasonable:\n",

    "These two assumptions indicate that long-term memory for the cointegrated assets will be almost non-existent. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, this trading strategy also has its limitations. Since the index value of AEX is much smaller than DAX, FTSE, and CAC 40, the number of AEX shares/contracts that need to be traded is much larger than its counterpart. Therefore, when the prices of the assets are different in the order of magnitude, it is better to double-check the position limit before trading the strategy."

    "- The cointegration relation can be defined by the properties of compounded returns rather than asset prices.\n",
